# Blockchain Transactions Challenge

### Challenge
Display a scrollable list of transactions retrieved from our `multiaddress API`. Each item should at least have a BTC value, some indication if money was sent or received and a transaction time. Please deliver the code as a zipped project so that it can be built locally, or host the project in a public GitHub/Bitbucket repo.
### Details
